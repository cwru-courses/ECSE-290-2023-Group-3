Things needed 
    - High priority (needed for final submission, but maybe not tomorrow)
        - Make it so there's some sort of indicator showing what tile you're over on the puzzles. (sorta done, infra set up)
        - Make a way to choose a random puzzle. This isn't hard, just some string manipulation to go into the right directory.
        - Finish all art, assets, etc
        - Implement night mode
        - Tune puzzle difficulty algorithm

    - Medium priority (would be nice, but not crazy important)
        - 

    - Low priority
        -
