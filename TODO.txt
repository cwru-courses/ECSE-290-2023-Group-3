Things needed 

    - Ultra high priority (needed for tomrrow)
        - Scene layout (i.e. the ability to walk around Bellflower, do the puzzles, etc)
            - Beginning scene + win scene
        - Easily send times to server and display times on a scoreboard
            - Send times as int variable, containing number of seconds. Use the "uploadTime(int time)" function to do this.
            - Scores come back as a list of ints ordered from greatest to least (i.e. [1,2,3,4,5]). This needs to be converted to minutes/seconds, then rendered on scoreboard.
        - Fix sliding bug
            - You are stopped when you are touching a wall. If you are touching a wall and slide in a direction such that you are still touching the wall, you won't get stopped on the next wall intersection (because you were touching a wall the whole time). This needs to be fixed.
        - Music and sound effects. I definitely don't have time to compose something today, so for now, we can just find a random, royalty-free song online that fits the vibe.

    - High priority (needed for final submission, but maybe not tomorrow)
        - Make it so you can't walk diagonally on ice. This makes the puzzles too easy.
        - Make it so there's some sort of indicator showing what tile you're over on the puzzles.
        - Make a way to choose a random puzzle. This isn't hard, just some string manipulation to go into the right directory.
        - Finish all art, assets, etc
        - Implement night mode
        - Tune puzzle difficulty algorithm

    - Medium priority (would be nice, but not crazy important)
        - 

    - Low priority
        -
